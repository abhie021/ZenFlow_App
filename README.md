# ZenFlow üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

ZenFlow is a simple, cross-platform desktop application designed to help you focus by temporarily blocking distracting websites. Built with JavaFX, it provides a minimal and professional interface to manage your focus sessions.

## Features

* **Block Distracting Websites:** Add any website (e.g., `youtube.com`, `facebook.com`) to your blocklist.
* **Timed Focus Sessions:** Set a timer for your focus session. Websites are automatically unblocked when the timer finishes.
* **Minimalist UI:** A clean, professional, and easy-to-use interface.
* **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## How It Works

ZenFlow works by temporarily adding entries to your system's **hosts file**, which redirects the distracting websites to your local machine (127.0.0.1). Because it modifies a system file, **the application must be run with administrator privileges**.
